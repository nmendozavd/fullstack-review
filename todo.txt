1. Client grabs input username and sends to the server
2. Server GET's user repos from github
  a) if user does not exists in gitub, I get back an error message
  b) if user does exists, I should get the repos for that user
3. Server has repo information, now I want to input data into DB
4. Send response back to Client
5.

- Client sends github username to server
- Server sends GET request to githubt for user's repos
  - if err, send error status code as response to client.
  - otherwise, next step
- Server writes repos to database
  - if err, send error status code as response to client
  - else, send success status
